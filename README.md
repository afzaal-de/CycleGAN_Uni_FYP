# CycleGAN_Uni_FYP
Enhanced breast ultrasound imaging by developing a CycleGAN model to translate noisy, low-quality images into
clearer, interpretable pseudo-anatomical displays.
Increased model accuracy from 71% to 91%, surpassing competitor benchmarks through optimized data
preprocessing, model tuning, and advanced parameter selection.
This improvement contributes to earlier and more accurate diagnoses of breast cancer, setting a new standard in
automated medical imaging translation.
